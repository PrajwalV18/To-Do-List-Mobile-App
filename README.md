# To-Do-List-Mobile-App

## Overview
This mobile app is a simple yet effective to-do list manager designed to streamline task organization and enhance productivity. Built for Android using Java the app incorporates essential features such as displaying, adding, marking as complete, and deleting to-do items. With a clean and intuitive user interface, along with robust data persistence, this app offers a seamless experience for managing tasks on the go.

## Features
  ### Display To-Do Items:
  View a list of existing to-do items with key details.
  
  ### Add New To-Do Items:
  Easily add new tasks with a user-friendly interface.
  
  ### Mark as Completed:
  Mark tasks as completed with a simple tap, providing a clear visual indicator of progress.

  ### Delete To-Do Items:
  Remove unwanted tasks effortlessly, maintaining a clutter-free list.

## User Interface
  The app boasts a minimalist and visually appealing design. Key UI elements include:
    Clean list view for displaying to-do items.
    Intuitive buttons for adding, completing, and deleting tasks.
    Seamless text fields for inputting new tasks.
    
## Data Persistence
  To ensure a seamless user experience, the app implements a robust data persistence mechanism. MYSQL is employed to store and retrieve to-do items, ensuring that users can access their tasks even after closing the app.

## Code Structure
  The code is organized into clear and modular functions/classes, following industry-standard naming conventions. Comments are included to explain complex sections, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## Platform and Technologies
  The app is developed for Android using Java, based on my knowledge of Java. The code was developed and tested in linux environment   (VM running launched on a windows machine, OS release https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04)
  Java version used "11.018"

## Testing
  Thorough testing has been conducted to ensure all features work as expected. Edge cases, such as adding an empty to-do item, are handled gracefully to enhance user experience.

## Challenges Faced
  During the development process, several challenges were encountered, such as connecting MYSQL using JDBC . However, this challenge was overcomed by carefully understanding the JDBC usage.

## Future Improvements
  ### User Accounts and Sync:
  Implement user accounts to allow users to sync their to-do lists across multiple devices. This could involve integrating with a cloud service like Firebase or creating a custom server.

  ### Reminders and Notifications:
  Integrate a reminder system that allows users to set deadlines for tasks and receive notifications. This could be particularly useful for time-sensitive or recurring tasks.

  ### Categories and Tags:
  Enable users to categorize and tag their to-do items for better organization. This feature can help users quickly filter and find tasks related to specific projects or areas of life.

  ### Priority Levels:
  Implement a priority system that allows users to assign priority levels to tasks. This can help users focus on high-priority items and manage their time more effectively.


## Conclusion
This to-do list app demonstrates a strong foundation in mobile app development, encompassing essential features, a user-friendly interface, and robust data persistence. Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to further enhance the app's functionality.
